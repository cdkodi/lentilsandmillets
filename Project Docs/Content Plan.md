# Content Plan: lentilsandmillets.com

## 1. Guiding Principles

All content created must adhere to the following principles:

*   **Authoritative & Trustworthy:** Every claim, especially regarding health and nutrition, must be backed by credible, cited sources.
*   **Visually Stunning:** The content must be beautiful. Food is a visual medium, and our assets must be aspirational and high-quality.
*   **Extremely Practical:** We are solving a problem. Every recipe and guide should be easy to follow, with clear steps and accessible ingredients.
*   **Engaging & Shareable:** The content should be interesting enough to read and compelling enough to share, creating natural virality.

## 2. Brand Voice and Tone

Our brand voice is that of a **"passionate food scientist meets a friendly, expert home cook."**

*   **Tone:** Accessible, inspiring, credible, and vibrant.
*   **We are:** Knowledgeable but not academic. Encouraging but not preachy. Passionate about food and science.
*   **We are not:** Clinical, boring, overly technical, or exclusive.

## 3. Core Content Pillars

Our content will be organized into four main pillars. This allows us to build deep expertise and makes it easy for users to find information.

1.  **The Science of Lentils & Millets:** Deep dives into the nutritional science. (e.g., "The Glycemic Index of Millets," "Complete Protein Pairing for Lentils").
2.  **The Art of Cooking:** The culinary pillar. This includes recipes, cooking techniques, and flavor pairing guides.
3.  **The Story of Our Food:** The history, culture, and sustainability of these ancient grains. (e.g., "The Journey of the Lentil: From the Fertile Crescent to Your Kitchen").
4.  **The Benefits for Your Body:** Directly addressing the user's needs. (e.g., "How Lentils Can Support Your Fitness Goals," "Gluten-Free Living with Millets").

## 4. Information Sourcing Strategy

To ensure authority, we will use a tiered approach to sourcing information:

*   **Tier 1 (Scientific Bedrock):** Peer-reviewed scientific journals (via Google Scholar, PubMed), publications from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and research from university agricultural and nutritional science departments.
*   **Tier 2 (Established Authorities):** Reputable culinary institutes, established food science textbooks, and historical archives.
*   **Tier 3 (Cross-Referencing):** Reputable online sources (e.g., Healthline's nutrition articles, Serious Eats for culinary techniques) will be used for inspiration but always cross-referenced with Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources.

## 5. The Content Creation Engine (Workflow & Tools)

This is a step-by-step process for turning raw information into published content.

**Step 1: Research & Synthesis (The AI Assistant)**
*   **Action:** Use an advanced AI model (like Gemini) to research a topic using the approved sources. The goal is to get a comprehensive summary and a list of key facts and citations.
*   **Tool:** Gemini for research and summarization.

**Step 2: Fact-Checking & Outline (The Human Editor)**
*   **Action:** A human editor must verify every claim from the AI summary against the original Tier 1 sources. The editor then creates a detailed outline for the content piece.
*   **Tool:** Human expertise, Google Docs for collaboration.

**Step 3: Writing & Editing (The Brand Voice)**
*   **Action:** The verified outline is used to write the final piece, focusing on infusing the brand's voice and tone. The piece is edited for clarity, flow, and engagement.
*   **Tool:** Human writers/editors, Grammarly/Hemingway App for polish.

**Step 4: Visual Asset Generation (The Creative AI & Sourcing)**
*   **Action:** Create stunning visuals for each piece of content.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **AI Image Generation:** Midjourney or DALL-E 3 for unique, stylized, and branded images that don't look like stock photos.
    *   **Photography:** For recipes, high-quality original photography is a must. If not feasible initially, use high-quality, carefully selected stock photos from Unsplash or Pexels.
    *   **Video:** Use simple tools like Canva or CapCut to create short-form videos for social media from photos and video clips.

**Step 5: Publication & Delivery**
*   **Action:** The final text and visuals are assembled and published on the website.
*   **Tool:** A modern, fast Content Management System (CMS) like Webflow, Ghost, or a headless CMS.

## 6. Content Distribution & Repurposing

We use a **"Pillar and Spoke"** model. The pillar is the main content piece (e.g., a blog post). The spokes are the social media assets derived from it.

| Content Format | Platform(s) | Key Elements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar Post** | Website/Blog | 1500+ words, deep dive, SEO optimized, multiple images, cited sources. |
| **Recipe Card** | Website/Pinterest | Printable, visually clean, with clear instructions and nutrition facts. |
| **Carousel Post** | Instagram, Facebook | 5-7 slides summarizing the key takeaways from the pillar post. |
| **Short-Form Video** | TikTok, Instagram Reels | 30-60 second video showing the cooking process or a key tip. Fast-paced, music-driven. |
| **Infographic** | Pinterest, Blog | Visual representation of data or a process (e.g., "Types of Millets"). |
| **Email Newsletter** | Email | Drives traffic back to the pillar post, shares a weekly recipe, builds community. |

## 7. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We will track the following metrics to measure the success of our content:

*   **Website:** Organic Traffic, Keyword Rankings, Bounce Rate, Email List Signups.
*   **Social Media:** Engagement Rate (likes, shares, comments), Follower Growth, Website Clicks.
*   **Business:** Once e-commerce is live, we will track the **Content Conversion Rate** (i.e., what percentage of people who read a piece of content end up buying a kit).
