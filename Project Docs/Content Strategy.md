# Content Strategy: Lentils & Millets Launch Plan

This document provides a specific, actionable strategy for the initial content launch of lentilsandmillets.com.

## Launch Content Volume

To ensure a successful launch, we will prepare **20 pillar articles** before the site goes live.

This volume will:
*   Establish immediate authority and provide a rich user experience.
*   Populate each of the **4 Core Content Pillars** with 5 articles each.
*   Create a strong foundation for search engine optimization (SEO).
*   Provide ample source material for an initial wave of social media content (carousels, videos, infographics) as per the "Pillar and Spoke" model.

## Presentation: Lentils vs. Millets

To provide clarity and a structured user journey, "Lentils" and "Millets" will be treated as two primary, distinct categories across the platform.

1.  **Dedicated Hub Pages:** The website's main navigation will feature "Lentils" and "Millets." Each will link to a dedicated hub page that aggregates all content for that ingredient.
2.  **Visual Differentiation:** We will use subtle visual cues to distinguish the sections, such as a unique color accent or icon for each category.
3.  **Comparative Content:** A key part of our strategy will be to create articles that directly compare the two, targeting users who are curious about the differences and benefits of each.
4.  **Robust Tagging:** Every article will be tagged with a clear and consistent system (e.g., `lentils`, `millets`, `recipes`, `science`, `fitness`, `gluten-free`) to allow for easy filtering and discovery.

## SEO & Competitor Analysis Workflow

To ensure our content is data-driven and competitive, we will use the DataForSEO API via a command-line MCP (Marketing Cloud Platform). This workflow will be used to refine our content strategy, identify new opportunities, and optimize our articles for search engines.

### Step 1: Discovering the Tool's Capabilities

The first step is to understand the full capabilities of the command-line tool.

*   **Action:** Execute the tool's help command (e.g., `mcp --help` or `dataforseo --help`) to get a full list of commands, subcommands, and options.
*   **Goal:** Identify the specific functions for keyword research, SERP analysis, and competitor analysis.

### Step 2: Keyword Analysis

This step focuses on identifying the high-value keywords that our target audience is searching for.

*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Seed Keywords:** Use the topics from our content plan as initial "seed" keywords (e.g., "lentil nutrition," "how to cook millet").
    2.  **Keyword Ideas:** Use the MCP to find related keywords, search volume, keyword difficulty, and CPC data.
    3.  **Question Keywords:** Specifically search for question-based keywords (who, what, why, how, are) to generate ideas for in-depth pillar content.
*   **Goal:** Produce a prioritized list of keywords based on a balance of **high search volume** and **low keyword difficulty**.

### Step 3: Competitor Analysis

We will analyze the top-ranking content and domains for our target keywords to understand the competitive landscape.

*   **Actions:**
    1.  **SERP Analysis:** Use the MCP to get the top 10 search engine results (SERP) for our primary keywords.
    2.  **Analyze Top Competitors:** Identify the top 3-5 competing websites from the SERP data. Use the MCP to analyze their domains and identify the other keywords they rank for, revealing potential "content gaps."
*   **Goal:** Understand what type of content is currently ranking, how authoritative the competing domains are, and what topics our competitors are covering that we are not.

### Step 4: Synthesis and Actionable Recommendations

The final step is to translate the collected data into a concrete, actionable strategy.

*   **Action:** Process the output (JSON/CSV) from the MCP and consolidate the findings into a new `SEO Analysis.md` file.
*   **Goal:** This report will contain:
    *   A table of **top-priority keywords** to target.
    *   A list of **new article ideas** based on content gaps.
    *   Recommendations to **optimize existing articles** with the newly identified keywords.
    *   A summary of the top 3 competitors and their apparent content strategy.
