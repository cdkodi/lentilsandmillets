### Option 1: Detailed, Comprehensive Prompt (Recommended)

This prompt is ideal for a sophisticated design AI. It provides deep context to ensure the design aligns with your brand strategy, target audience, and content structure.

**Prompt for Design AI:**

"Generate a series of UI/UX design concepts for a new website called **lentilsandmillets.com**. The website is a content and e-commerce platform dedicated to educating consumers and selling lentil and millet products.

**Core Concept: A Dual-Brand Identity**
The entire design must be built around a central theme of two distinct but complementary product lines:

1.  **Lentils - "The Protein Powerhouse":**
    *   **Vibe:** Accessible, practical, convenient, and family-friendly.
    *   **Keywords:** Hearty, quick, versatile, budget-friendly.
    *   **Color Palette:** Warm, earthy tones (think terracotta, deep reds, browns, warm greens).

2.  **Millets - "The Ancient Superfood":**
    *   **Vibe:** Premium, health-conscious, exploratory, and scientific.
    *   **Keywords:** Gluten-free, sustainable, gourmet, nutritious.
    *   **Color Palette:** Bright, golden, and amber tones (think sunshine, gold, light wood, creamy whites).

**Overall Aesthetic & Brand Voice:**
*   **Style:** Clean, modern, minimalist, and vibrant. It should feel like a premium food magazine.
*   **Voice:** "A passionate food scientist meets a friendly, expert home cook." The design should be trustworthy and authoritative, yet warm and inspiring.
*   **Photography/Imagery:** Aspirational, high-quality, and unique. Avoid generic stock photos. The style should be stylized and branded, with a focus on beautiful food photography.

**Key Pages to Design:**

1.  **The Homepage:**
    *   Must introduce the "dual-brand" concept immediately.
    *   Feature a hero section that elegantly showcases both lentils and millets.
    *   Include clear entry points for users: "New to Lentils? Start Here" and "Discover Ancient Millets."
    *   Showcase visually stunning recipe cards.

2.  **A Recipe Page:**
    *   The design needs to be extremely practical and easy to follow.
    *   Incorporate a clean, printable recipe card format.
    *   Visually distinguish between lentil recipes and millet recipes using the established color palettes and icon badges (e.g., a "High Protein" badge for a lentil dish, a "Gluten-Free" badge for a millet dish).
    *   Include a section for "The Science Behind This Recipe" to reinforce authority.

**Must-Have UI Elements:**
*   A clear navigation bar with "Lentils," "Millets," "Recipes," "About," and "Shop."
*   Visual badges and icons to quickly communicate benefits (e.g., protein content, cooking time, gluten-free).
*   Advanced filtering options for recipes (by ingredient, diet, cooking time).
*   Mobile-first design principles are essential.

**Things to Avoid:**
*   A cluttered or busy layout.
*   Dark, unappetizing color schemes.
*   A rustic, old-fashioned, or "farmhouse" aesthetic.
*   Generic, low-quality stock imagery.

Please generate mockups for both desktop and mobile views."

### Option 2: Simpler, More Direct Prompt

Use this if the design tool prefers shorter, more direct instructions.

**Prompt for Design AI:**

"Design a website UI for **lentilsandmillets.com**, a premium food brand. The design must be clean, modern, and minimalist, with a vibrant, organic feel.

The site has two distinct sections:
1.  **Lentils:** Use a warm, earthy color palette (terracotta, deep reds, browns).
2.  **Millets:** Use a bright, golden color palette (amber, gold, creamy whites).

Create a homepage that introduces both sections clearly. Also, design a recipe page template that is beautiful, easy to read, and uses the different color palettes to show whether it's a lentil or millet recipe. The photography must be high-end and aspirational. Focus on a mobile-first layout."
