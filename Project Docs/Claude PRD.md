## Technical Requirements by Phase

### Phase 1: Content Authority Platform (Months 1-6)

#### Web Platform Requirements

### CMS Decision Analysis: WordPress vs. Payload CMS

#### Recommended Architecture: Payload 3.0 + Next.js on Vercel

**Single-Platform Cost Comparison:**
```
Payload on Vercel Stack (RECOMMENDED):
├── Vercel Pro: $20/month (team features, better limits)
├── Neon Postgres: $19/month (managed database)
├── Vercel Blob Storage: $5-10/month (file uploads)
└── Total: $44-49/month

WordPress Stack:
├── Hosting: $50-100/month (WP Engine/Kinsta)
├── Premium plugins: $30-50/month (ACF Pro, SEO, etc.)
├── CDN/Performance: $20-30/month
└── Total: $100-180/month
```

#### Why Payload 3.0 on Vercel is Optimal for This Project:

**Single-Platform Advantages:**
- ✅ **One dashboard**: Unified management for frontend, backend, database, and deployments
- ✅ **Simplified operations**: Single billing, monitoring, and support relationship
- ✅ **Integrated workflow**: GitHub → Vercel deployment with zero configuration
- ✅ **Preview deployments**: Test content changes before going live

**Performance Advantages:**
- Sub-2 second load times (critical for food blog SEO)
- Perfect Core Web Vitals scores with edge optimization
- Static generation for all recipe content
- Global CDN for both frontend and admin panel
- Serverless auto-scaling without server management

**Dual Product Line Architecture:**
```typescript
// Clean content modeling for lentils vs millets
export const Recipe = {
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'productLine',
      type: 'select',
      options: [
        { label: 'Lentils', value: 'lentils' },
        { label: 'Millets', value: 'millets' },
        { label: 'Both', value: 'combination' }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'cookingTime',
      type: 'number',
      admin: {
        condition: (data) => data.productLine === 'lentils'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'nutritionalFocus',
      type: 'select',
      options: ['protein', 'gluten-free', 'low-glycemic', 'sustainability']
    }
  ]
}
```
